### Sorting Algorithms & Big O Analysis

This project explores the fascinating world of sorting algorithms and their time complexity analysis using the Big O notation. Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science, enabling us to efficiently organize data and solve various computational problems. In this project, we will delve into the implementation of several sorting algorithms, each with its unique approach and efficiency.
Project Overview

This project is designed for teams of two students to work together and gain a deep understanding of sorting algorithms and their time complexities. We will implement four different sorting algorithms, understand how to evaluate their time complexity, and learn how to choose the most suitable algorithm for specific scenarios. Additionally, we will explore the concept of stable sorting algorithms, which have distinct properties when handling equal elements in the input data.

#### Key Learning Objectives:

    Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
    Understand and evaluate the time complexity of algorithms using Big O notation.
    Choose the most appropriate sorting algorithm for a given input.
    Explore the concept of a stable sorting algorithm.
